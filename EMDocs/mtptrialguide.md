## Exercise 2: Set up and configure Exchange Online Protection

### Introduction
Microsoft Exchange Online Protection (EOP) is a cloud-based email filtering service that helps protect your organization against spam and malware, and includes features to safeguard your organization from messaging-policy violations. EOP can simplify the management of your messaging environment and alleviate many of the burdens that come with maintaining on-premises hardware and software.    
You can use EOP for messaging protection in a standalone environment, as part of Microsoft Exchange Online, and in a hybrid deployment.

### Prerequisites
You must have the following prerequisites for a successful set up:
- You have Office 365 and your subscription includes Exchange Online. (For the premium Office Advanced Threat Protection topics, an Office ATP license is required either through Office 365 E5 or as a standalone service.)
- You have Exchange Online Protection Admin permission for advanced protection policy definition and have added your domain.

### Add recipients and enable Directory-Based Edge Blocking
The Directory Based Edge Blocking (DBEB) feature in Exchange Online and Exchange Online Protection (EOP) lets you reject messages for invalid recipients at the service network perimeter. DBEB lets admins add mail-enabled recipients to Office 365 and block all messages sent to email addresses that aren't present in Office 365.

To ensure your accepted domain is set to Internal relay, use the following procedure:
1. In the Windows 10 client machine, [Jump Host 01](https://labondemand.com/LabProfile/EditInstructions/45973), ensure you're in the **Microsoft 365 admin center** page.
2. At the bottom of the left navigation, expand **Admin centers** menu, then select **Exchange** to go to the **Exchange admin center (EAC)**. 
3. In the EAC, go to **Mail flow** > **Accepted domains**.
4. Select the domain and click **Edit**.
5. Ensure that the domain type is set to **Internal relay**. If it's set to **Authoritative**, change it to **Internal relay** and click **Save**.

To add valid users to Office 365, use one of the following:
- **Directory synchronization** 
  Add valid users to Office 365 by synchronizing from your on-premises Active Directory environment to Azure Active Directory in the cloud.
- **Add users via remote Windows PowerShell**
  Adding and managing mail users by running remote Windows PowerShell is useful for adding multiple records and creating scripts.
- **Add users directly in the Exchange admin center (EAC)**
  Adding and managing mail users directly in the EAC is useful for adding one user at a time.

To set your accepted domain to Authoritative, use the following procedure:
1. In the EAC, go to **Mail flow** > **Accepted domains**.
2. Select the domain and click **Edit**.
3. Set the domain type to **Authoritative**.
4. Click **Save**, and confirm enablement of Directory Based Edge Blocking.

### Use the EAC to set up mail flow
Connectors are created in the Exchange admin center (EAC) to enable mail flow between EOP and your on-premises mail servers.
1. The **email server is set up** and capable of sending and receiving mail to and from the Internet.
2. On-premises email server has **Transport Layer Security (TLS) enabled**, with a valid certification authority-signed (CA-signed) certificate.
3. The default certificate for the **Receive connector is updated** to securely receive email between Office 365 and your email server via Edge Transport Server or Client Access Server using the *TlsCertificateName* parameter on the Set-ReceiveConnector cmdlet in the Exchange Management Shell.
4. The **name or IP address of your external-facing email** server has been noted. If you're using Exchange, this will be the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of your Edge Transport server or CAS that will receive email from Office 365.
5. **Port 25 on the firewall is open** for Office 365 to connect to email servers, ensuring connections are accepted from all IP addresses.
6. The connector is created via the Exchange admin center.

### Define Spam Routing
Detected spam can be automatically routed via a custom spam-filter policy, defining high confidence spam and sending to the appropriate folder.
1. In the Exchange admin center (EAC), navigate to **Protection** > **Spam filter**.
   You can edit the default policy or add a new policy on the general page.
2. Double-click the default policy in order to edit this company-wide policy.
3. Click the **+ New** icon to create a new custom spam-filter policy that can be applied to users, groups, and domains in your organization. You can also edit existing custom policies by double-clicking them.
4. On the **spam and bulk email actions** page, under **Spam** and **High confidence spam**, keep the default **Move messages to Junk Email** folder selection.
   You can also do the following:
   - **Delete message** deletes the entire message, including all attachments.
   - **Quarantine message** sends the message to quarantine instead of the intended recipients. The **Retain spam for (days)** allows you to specify the number of days of quarantine. (It will automatically be deleted after the time elapses. The default value is 15 days which is the maximum value, and the minimum value is 1 day.)
   - **Add X-header** sends the message to the specified recipients, but adds X-header text to the message header in order to identify the message as spam. Using this text as an identifier, you can also create inbox rules or use a downstream device to act on the message. The default X-header text is **This message appears to be spam**.
   - **Prepend subject line with text** sends the message to the intended recipients but prepends the subject line with the text that you specify in the **Prefix subject line with this text** input box. Using this text as an identifier, you can optionally create rules to filter or route the messages as necessary.
   - **Redirect message to email address** sends the message to a designated email address instead of the intended recipients. Specify the **redirect** address in the **Redirect to this email address** input box.
5. Under **Bulk email**, select a threshold to treat bulk email as spam. Level 1 indicates most bulk email as spam and level 9 allows the most bulk email to be delivered. The service then performs the configured action, such as sending the message to the recipient's **Junk Email** folder.

### Migrate Spam Block and Allow Lists
Known suspicious senders and domains can be listed and blocked, while trusted senders remain on an Allow list to ensure appropriate and undisrupted receipt of information.

On the Block Lists page, you can specify entries such as senders or domains to be marked as spam. The service then applies the configured high confidence spam action to email that matches these entries.
- Add unwanted senders to the Sender block list. Click **Add +** . In the selection dialog box, add the sender addresses to block, separating multiple entries using a semi-colon or a new line. Click **Ok** to return to the **Block Lists** page.
- Add unwanted domains to the Domain block list. Click **Add +**. In the selection dialog box, add the domains you want to block, separating multiple entries using a semi-colon or a new line. Click **Ok** to return to the **Block Lists** page.

On the Allow Lists page, specify entries such as senders or domains to be delivered to the inbox. Email from these entries is not processed by the spam filter.
- Add trusted senders to the Sender allow list. Click **Add +**. In the selection dialog box, add the sender addresses you wish to allow, separating multiple entries using a semi-colon or a new line. Click **Ok** to return to the **Allow Lists** page.
- Add trusted domains to the Domain allow list. Click **Add +**. In the selection dialog box, add the domains you wish to allow, separating multiple entries using a semi-colon or a new line. Click **Ok** to return to the **Allow Lists** page.

### Create Bypass Rule for Spam
Spam can easily be detected and contained via email flow bypass rules.
1. In the EAC, navigate to **Mail flow** > **Rules**. Choose **Add +** and choose **Bypass spam filtering**.
2. Give the rule a name. Under **Apply this rule if**, choose **The sender** and select one of the following conditions:
   - To specify a domain, choose **domain is**. In the **Specify domain** dialog box, enter the domain of the sender to designate as safe, such as contoso.com. **Add +** to move it to the list of phrases. Repeat this step to add domains, and click Ok to confirm.
   - To specify a user, choose is this person. In the Select members dialog box, add the user from the list or type the user and click Check names. Repeat this step to add users and click **Ok** to confirm.
3. Select the **Stop processing more rules** check box to ensure that no other rule can reverse the bypass action.
4. For the **Match sender address in message** option, select **Header or envelope**.
5. You may make selections to audit the rule, test the rule, activate the rule during a specific time period, and others.
6. Choose **Save** to save the rule.

After you create and enforce the rule, spam filtering is bypassed for the domain or user you specified.

### Create a Transport Rule
Use the Exchange admin center to create a transport rule that blocks messages sent from a domain or user.
1. In the EAC, navigate to **Mail flow** > **Rules**. Choose **Add +** and choose **Create a new rule**.
2. Give the rule a name and then click **More options**.
3. Under **Apply this rule if**, choose **The sender** and select one of the following conditions:
   - To specify a domain, choose domain is. In the Specify domain dialog box, enter the sender domain from which you want to block messages, such as contoso.com. Click Add  to move it to the list of phrases. Repeat this step to add domains, and click Ok to confirm.
   - To specify a user, choose is this person. In the Select members dialog box, add the user from the list or type the user and click Check names. Repeat this step to add users, and click Ok to confirm.
 4. Under **Do the following**, choose **Block the message** and click one of the other options such as **Delete the message without notifying anyone**.
 5. Click **More options**, and then for the **Match sender address in message** option, select **Header or envelope**.
 6. Choose **Save** to save the rule.

After you create and enforce the rule, any messages sent from the domain or user you specify will be blocked.

### Mark Visual Basic or JavaScript as Spam

1. Go to **Control** > **Templates**.
2. Select a policy template from the list, and then choose **+** (Create policy).
3. Customize the policy (select filters, actions, and other settings), and then choose **Create**.
4. On the **Policies** tab, choose the policy to see the relevant matches (activities, files, alerts). **Tip**: To cover all your cloud environment security scenarios, create a policy for each risk category.

##### Create a new policy based on investigation results
When drilling down for specific information while investigating the **Activity log**, **Files** or **Accounts**, you can create a new policy based on the results of your investigation.
1. In the console, click **Investigate** followed by **Activity log**, **Files**, or **Accounts**.
2. Use the filters at the top of the page to limit the search results to the suspicious area. In the Activity log page, click **Activity** and select **Admin logon**.
3. Under **IP address**, select **Category** and set the value to not include IP address categories you've created for your recognized domains, such as your admin, corporate, and VPN IP addresses.
4. In the upper right corner of the console click **New policy from search**.
5. A create policy page opens containing the filters you used in your investigation. Modify the template as needed for your custom policy. Every property and field of this new investigation-based policy can be modified according to your needs.

#### Create a Cloud App Security access policy
Microsoft Cloud App Security access policies enable real-time monitoring and control over access to cloud apps based on user, location, device and app. You can create access policies for any device, including devices that are not domain joined and not managed by Windows Intune by rolling out client certificates to managed devices or by leveraging existing certificates, such as third-party MDM certificates.
1. In the Microsoft Cloud App Security portal, select **Control** followed by **Policies**.
2. On the **Policies** page, click **Create policy** and select **Access policy**.
3. In the **Access policy** window, assign a name for your policy, such as **Block access from unmanaged devices**.
4. Under **Activity source** in the **Activities matching all of the following** section, select additional activity filters to apply to the policy. These can include the following options:
   - **Device tags**: Use this filter to identify unmanaged devices.
   - **Location**: Use this filter to identify unknown (and therefore risky) locations.
   - **IP address**: Use this filter to filter per IP addresses or use previously assigned IP address tags.
   - **User agent tag**: Use this filter to enable the heuristic to identify mobile and desktop apps. This filter can be set to equals or does not equal Native client and should be tested against your mobile and desktop apps for each cloud app.
5. Under **Actions**, select one of the following:
   - **Allow**: Set this action to explicitly allow access according to the policy filters you set.
   - **Block**: Set this action to explicitly block access according to the policy filters you set.
6. Create an alert for each matching event with the policy's severity, set an alert limit, and select whether you want the alert as an email, a text message, or both.

## Exercise 6: Set up and configure Azure Advanced Threat Protection

### Introduction
Azure Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) is a cloud service that helps protect your enterprise hybrid environments from multiple types of advanced targeted cyber-attacks and insider threats, utilizing technology that detects multiple suspicious activities and focuses on distinct phases of the cyber-attack kill chain. Azure ATP searches for three main types of attacks: Malicious attacks, abnormal behavior, and security issues and risks.

Azure ATP takes information from multiple data-sources such as logs and events in your network to learn the behavior of users and other entities in the organization and build a behavioral profile about them. Azure ATP can receive events and logs from:
- SIEM Integration
- Windows Event Forwarding (WEF)
- Directly from the Windows Event Collector (for the sensor)
- RADIUS Accounting from VPNs

### Prerequisites
- Administrative access to the Azure portal
- Access to on-premises domain controller
- Completion of Lab Exercise #5 (Set up and configure Microsoft Defender ATP) if you want to configure Azure ATP integration with Microsoft Defender ATP.

### Setting Up Azure Advanced Threat Protection
An Azure ATP workspace is required to set up Azure ATP for your tenant. Configuring Azure ATP is a multi-phased process requiring configuration for both on-premises components (i.e. domain controller) and cloud components (i.e. Azure ATP workspace).

> [!Important]
> Perform these steps in the domain controller VM, [DC01](https://labondemand.com/LabProfile/EditInstructions/45973)

### Configure Azure AD Sync with domain controller
Azure AD Sync allows you to join your on-premises Active Directory with your Azure Active Directory. Perform the following steps on your on-premises domain controller:
1. Sign in to the domain controller server with local user credentials (provided in the Resources tab). 
2. In a new browser window, browse to the [Azure management portal](https://portal.azure.com).
3. In the left navigation menu, select **Azure Active Directory**.
4. Under **Manage**, click **Azure AD Connect**.
5. Click **Download Azure AD Connect**.
6. Navigate to and double-click **AzureADConnect.msi**, and then downloaded locally.
7. On the Welcome screen, select the box agreeing to the licensing terms, then click **Continue**.

11. On the Connect to AD DS screen, enter the credentials for the local domain controller admin user (the domain value can be in either NetBIOS or FQDN format): ```user name: contoso\administrator++ and password: +++pass@word1*```.
12. Click **Next**.
13. The **Azure AD sign-in configuration** page shows which Azure AD user authentication domains have been properly verified.
   If a domain is marked with **Not Added* or **Not Verified**, confirm that they are domains you won't be using to authenticate users in Azure AD. Ensure that the domains you do want to use for user authentication have been verified in Azure AD.

   **Tip**: If you have to make changes to your domains, you can leave this wizard open, make the necessary changes, then come back to this wizard and click the Refresh button in the lower right.
14. On the **Ready to configure** screen, click **Install**.
15. Ensure that the **Start the synchronization process as soon as configuration completes** checkbox is checked. This will immediately trigger a full synchronization to Azure AD of all users, groups, and contacts.
16. Ensure that the Exchange hybrid deployment checkbox is unchecked. This lab doesn't use Exchange in a hybrid scenario so this checkbox is unnecessary.
17. When the installation completes, click **Exit**.

### Create an Azure ATP Workspace
Azure ATP Workspace enables you to manage various Azure ATP functionality.
1. On the domain controller PC, browse to the [Azure ATP workspace portal](https://portal.atp.azure.com). If necessary, sign in with your M365 admin user account.
2. Click **Create Workspace**.
3. In the **Create New Workspace** dialog, name your workspace (e.g. "ContosoLab123" -- this name must be universally unique across all Azure ATP workspaces).

 Click the plus sign (+). The **Add entity** (user or computer) field is searchable and will autofill with entities in your network. Click **Save**.

## Exercise 7: Set up Azure Security Center

### Introduction
Azure Security Center (ASC) provides unified security management and advanced threat protection across hybrid cloud workloads. It collects data from your Azure VMs and non-Azure computers to monitor for security vulnerabilities and threats. Data is collected using the Microsoft Monitoring Agent. The agent reads various security-related configurations and event logs from the onboarded machines and copies the data to ASC workspace for analysis.

### Prerequisites
For managing only Azure-based resources, the free tier of Azure Security Center is available to all organizations for no charge. Anyone with security administrator or higher level of directory access can administer Azure Security Center in free tier using the Azure Management Portal.
For managing non-Azure workloads (i.e. hybrid infrastructure and/or resources in third-party cloud services such as AWS), the following items are required:  

- Upgrade to Standard Tier
- Azure Subscription associated with the tenant
- Administrative user access to the Azure Subscription
- Completion of [Exercise 6: Set up and configure Azure Advanced Threat Protection](#exercise-6-set-up-and-configure-azure-advanced-threat-protection)

For this lab, we assume you have a hybrid infrastructure to manage. We assume the Windows Server-based domain controller PC is running on-premises and will be managed by ASC.

### Setting Up Azure Security Center
To leverage the full capabilities of Azure Security Center, you'll need to upgrade ASC from Free Tier to Standard Tier. This upgrade will require an Azure Subscription that is associated with your tenant/environment. You must have administrative access to the Azure Subscription.

#### Create an Azure Subscription from Azure Pass
An Azure Pass promo code is provided for you to use for the purpose of this lab. The code can be found in the Resources tab. Follow these steps to redeem your Azure Azure pass for an Azure subscription.
1. On the Windows 10 client PC, navigate to the [Microsoft Azure Pass](https://www.microsoftazurepass.com) page. Ensure that you are signed in as your tenant's global admin user.
2. Click **Confirm Microsoft Account**.
3. Copy and paste the Azure Pass promo code in the **Enter Promo Code** textbox, and then click **Claim Promo Code**.
4. In the next page, review your free Azure Subscription details, then click **Activate**.
5. In the **About you** page, update your personal information (optional), and then click **Next**.
6. Agree to the terms and conditions, and then click **Sign up**. When the signup process is complete, you'll be redirected to the Azure management portal automatically.

#### Create a Security Center workspace in your tenant
The first step in setting up Azure Security Center is creating a workspace.
1. Go to the [Azure Management Portal page](https://portal.azure.com) and sign in as the tenant global admin user.
2. In the left navigation pane, click **Security Center**.
3. In the **Getting started** page, click **Start trial** to begin. By doing this, you have upgraded your tenant's ASC service from Free Tier to Standard Tier.
4. Click **Install agents**. This will enable the Microsoft Monitoring Agent to be automatically installed on all VMs hosted in the Azure Subscription associated with this ASC workspace.

#### Define Security Policies and respond to alerts
ASC automatically creates a default security policy for each of your Azure subscriptions. Security policies are comprised of recommendations that you can turn on or turn off according to the security requirements of that subscription. To make changes to the default security policy, you need to be an owner, contributor, or security administrator of the subscription.
1. At the Security Center main menu, select **Security policy**.
2. Select the Azure Subscription you want to use.
3. For each security configuration you want to monitor, select **On**. Security Center will continuously assess the configuration of your environment and when vulnerability exists, Security Center will generate a security recommendation. Select **Off** if the security configuration is not recommended or not relevant. After selecting the policies that are applicable to your environment, click **Save**.
4. Return to the **Security Center - Overview** page.
5. On the overview dashboard, review VM and computer security recommendations by selecting **Overview** > **Compute & apps**.
6. On Security Center dashboard, review networking by selecting **Overview** > **Networking**.
7. On Security Center dashboard, review data and storage by selecting **Overview** > **Data & storage**.
8. On Security Center dashboard, review identity and access by selecting **Overview** > **Identity & Access**.
9. On Security Center dashboard, click Security alerts tile to see alert details. Click **Filter** on the **Security Alerts**. The filter opens and you select the date, state, and severity values you wish to see. Select a security alert to learn more about the event(s) that triggered the alert and what, if any, steps you need to take to remediate an attack.
Azure Security Center continues to monitor all critical workloads, making security recommendations for associated computers, VMs, data, and identities.

#### Onboard On-Premises Computers to Azure Security Center
In addition to Azure-hosted virtual machines, you can also monitor on-premises computers. This is done through a service application running on the computers, called Microsoft Monitoring Agent. In this exercise, you'll onboard your lab's domain controller PC to your tenant's Azure Security Center workspace that you created earlier.

*Perform these steps in the Domain Controller PC.*

1. Log in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) as tenant global admin user.
2. In the Azure portal left navigation, select **Security Center**.
3. Under **Resource Security Hygiene**, select **Compute & apps**.
4. Click the **+ Add Computers** link at the top of the blade.
5. A Log Analytics workspace (also known as an OMS Workspace) is required to onboard non-Azure computers to Security Center. If you already have a Log Analytics workspace created in your subscription, you will see it listed here. Otherwise, you'll have to create one to proceed. To create a new Log Analytics workspace, click **add a new workspace** link.
6. Click **OMS Workspace**, and then fill in the log analytics workspace creation form. The OMS workspace name has to be globally unique across Azure.
7. Click **OK** to finish creating the workspace.
8. Back in the **Add new non-Azure computers** blade, click **+ Add Computers** next to the newly created workspace.
9. In the **Direct Agent** blade, select the **Download Windows Agent (64 bit)** link to download the setup file.
10. Click **Run** to open the Microsoft Monitoring Agent Windows Agent Setup wizard.
11. On the Welcome page, click **Next**.
12. On the License Terms page, read the license, and then select **I Agree**.
13. On the Destination Folder page, change or keep the default installation folder, and then select **Next**.
14. On the Agent Setup Options page, choose **Connect the agent to Azure Log Analytics (OMS)**, then select **Next**.
15. Copy/paste the **Workspace ID** and **Primary Key** values from the **Direct Agent** blade in Security Center to the setup form, and then select **Next**.
16. On the Ready to Install page, review your choices and then select **Install**.
17. On the Configuration completed successfully page, select **Finish**.

When complete, the Microsoft Monitoring Agent can be found in the onboarded computer's Control Panel. The log analytics service will start collecting data from the computer immediately.

#### View data collected in Log Analytics
Now that you have enabled data collection, lets run a simple log search example to see some data from the onboarded computer.
1. In the Azure Management Portal left navigation, click **All services**, type **log**, and then select **Log Analytics**.
2. Select the Log Analytics workspace name.
3. Under **General**, select **Logs** to load a new query page.
